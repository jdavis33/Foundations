Homework: Variable Type vs Object Type


1. Which of the following is considered boxing?

c. object myobjx = fx;




2. Which of the followings is considered unboxing?


b. double dblx =(double) fx;
NOTE: While it's not called out as an "obj", if you named your object "fx" then this would be an example of unboxing as well as d.
d. int ix = (int) objy;



3. Object objdblx is of type double. Assign the value of this object to a variable of type float.

float fx = (float)objdblx;



4. Object objflx is of type float. Assign the value of this object to another variable of type double.

double dx = (double)(float)objflx;



5. Convert the string strx to a double dblx:

double dblx = double.Parse(strx)



6. Convert the integer ix to a float fx:

float fx = ix
NOTE:  This assumes the integer ix was already declared in an earlier statement


7. Convert the double dblx to a string strx:

string strx = dlbx.ToString()
NOTE:  This assumes the double dlbx was already declared in an earlier statement



8. Object is the ______ class of all other data types.

base



9. What is an object (the definition)?

An object is a "thing" (type / class) that has definition / properties and functionality. As stated above in answer 9 it is also the base class of all other data types.



10. How do you declare an object in C#?

By using the "object" type.



11. What is the difference between an object and a variable?
An object type is very general.  It can hold any variable type without the need to declare a specific type (other than object).
An object can also be a class
